# 7segements

The goal is to write a command line tool that displays a number as 7-segmented digits.

Currently the source is 165 bytes in length.

This branch is a hack. It used argv[0] for the table.

## Build:

    gcc -w -o "|O6VYNnX~^" 7segments.c

## Run:

    "./|O6VYNnX~^" 123

## Output:

        _   _
     |  _|  _|
     | |_   _|

This project is just for fun and learning purposes.
